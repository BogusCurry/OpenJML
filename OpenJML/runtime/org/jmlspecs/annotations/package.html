<p>This package of annotation definitions defines the various annotations 
used by JML.  They enable replacing the old style of specially formatted 
comments by the now standard Java annotations.  For example
<pre>
/*@ non_null */
</pre>
can now be written simply as
<pre>@NonNull</pre>
</p>
