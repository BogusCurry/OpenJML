VARIOUS TASKS
run jmldoc instead of javadoc
implement method calls, new objects
implement method calls in jml expressions
implement loops, \index, \values
implement types, \typeof, \type, \TYPE, <:, instanceof, type casts
implement boxing and other implicit conversions
implement set comprehension
implement quantified expressions
implement the fcn-like JML tokens
implement lbl-expressions: use SMT functionality - decide how to print
implement \max, <# <#= other concurrency 
implement field access and assignment
implement array access and assignment
implement new array
finish frame conditions
put comments in basic blocks in a consistent way
implement inherited specs
implement using specs from referenced classes
change scan to scanret where appropriate; same for other visitors?
implement alloc, \fresh, heapvar?
move assumption checking to JmlAssertionAdder

NOTES and TODO items from code reviews and major features

To review:
- everything in OpenJML, JMLAnnotations, Specs, OpenJMLUI except
JmlFlow



To Do:
JmlFlow - implement flow checks for JML statements and expressions
review notes below about OpenJDK

Jmldoc:
- nested model classes are written with fully qualified names and without links to their own pages
- some errors on Enums in generating jmldoc* tests
- model enums
